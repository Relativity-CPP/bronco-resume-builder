# **bronco-resume-builder**
Web application used to help create resum√©'s for Cal Poly Pomona students
to prepare them for applying to certain jobs. Our application will provide
useful suggestions to better their descriptions of their experience,
provide clean templates to keep their resume organized,
and print out the resume on a Microsoft Word document.

Website will soon be found in cpp-relativity.com, but only locally at the moment.
